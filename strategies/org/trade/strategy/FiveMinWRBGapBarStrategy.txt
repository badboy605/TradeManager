1/ Enter in the direction of the Tradingday Tab Side field when the first 5min bar direction co-inside.
2/ Size with a stop at the first 5min bars Low (so for Long position Quantity= Risk/(High-Low) include rounding). Use a STPLMT order with a range from the Entry Limit table.
3/ Bar must be within the Entry Limit table % Range Bar. i.e in this case 2%
4/ If the position is not filled by 10:30 cancel the order.
5/ Add 1c to the entry price and round over/under whole/half numbers in the direction of the trade, same for stop price.

E.g. If first 5min bar is H=21.50 L=21.15 Open= 21.2 Close=21.40 and the Side is Long, 
then position order will be Buy STPLMT=21.51-21.55 (STPLMT range 0.04 from EntryLimit table and as we are at 21.5 we also buy
over/under whole/half numbers), Quantity=Risk/(21.51-21.2) rounded to +/-100 shares (see EntryLimit table).
 
TODO Add logic to use the previous days +/-WRB size as a definition of a WRB and then take an entry.
